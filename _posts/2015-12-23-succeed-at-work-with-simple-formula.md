Many people think that successful people owe it more to luck than anything else. It is somehow true, luck is really important but, it does not make the difference at all. Luck is random, you will be lucky sometimes and sometimes not. When I hear someone tell me how lucky I am, I respond: “Yes! and the harder I work, the luckier I get”. This is the key to succeed.

When I hear someone tell me how lucky I am, I respond: “Yes! and the harder I work, the luckier I get”.
The formula is very simple, it works just with three elements: Knowledge, Skills and Attitude.

Let's analyze the meaning of each element:

**Knowledge** [nol-ij] noun

1. facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education.
2. the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.

**Skill** [skl] noun.

1. Proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through training or experience. 
2. An art, trade, or technique, particularly one requiring use of the hands or body. A developed talent or ability.

**Attitude** [ˈætɪˌtjuːd] noun

1. the way a person views something or tends to behave towards it, often in an evaluative way
2. a theatrical pose created for effect (esp in the phrase strike an attitude)3. a position of the body indicating mood or emotion
3. a hostile manner: don't give me attitude, my girl.
 
**Knowledge is a long process**, you adquire knowledge everywhere: from school, at work, reading, talking with your friends, etc. Knowledge takes time, patience, dedication, interest, maturity, and experience.

**Skills can be adquired**. If you train and practice you will get skills on anything. The more you train the more skilled you will be.

**However, attitude makes the difference and breaks experience**. If you realized from the formula: knowledge and skills add up, but attitude multiplies. I have heart many times people saying: "you are too young for this position...", "you still need more experience for that..." if your attitude is 100% possitive I am sure you will compensate your lack of experience. What's more, if your attitude is 200% you will exceed the expectations with your new job, new position, etc.

So, you can use these three elements to:

- Do a self-assessment to analyze your current status. Then, set some objectives and goals and do periodic check to validate the accomplishment of them. You can also get feedback from your workmates, it would help you to be more accurate. 
- Evaluate, if you are a manager, the performance of your people. You can get a total score and analyze the strength points and weaknesses over time of each member of your team.

Evaluating yourself or your team, always keep in mind that attitude is your real key to succeed, no matter the experience or skills you have.
